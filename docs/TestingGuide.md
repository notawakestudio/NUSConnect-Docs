## **Our Believe & Strategy**

Our testing strategy is guided by the test trophy (By Kent C. Dodds):
![test trophy](https://res.cloudinary.com/kentcdodds-com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0/v1622744540/kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications/trophy_wx9aen.png)

Now that we are on the same page, let's go through our game plan.

### Our Belief

We want to empathize that we see tests as a critical part of well-written
program. We understand that software of significance should be tested. This
gives the developers great confidence that the software will work as expected.

### Our Strategy

- Static is a must (Supported by TypeScript & IDE integrations)
- Unit for critical components (Supported by Jest)
- Integration & E2E to ensure users experience what we build (Supported by
  Cypress)
   - Test cases are written per page & interactions permitted
   - Test cases should verify both non-logged in users and logged in users behaviors
- System and Acceptance Test (Supported by QA & real users)

### Test Artifacts
For the purpose of accessment and documentation, we provide the following visual test artifacts (Recorded test runs for end to end tests, test summary statistics etc) as a proof of test execution and feedback. The details of the test cases can be found in the codebase as well.

#### Video recorded of a Cypress End-to-end test run:
#TODO
#### Gif of automated test results of a Github Action run:

## **Setup Guide**

After running `yarn install`, you should be ready to start testing as all the
required dependencies are installed.

## **Static Test**

We developed our application in TypeScript to take advantage of the ability to
ensure type safety whenever possible. With the help of the IDE, any code that's
loosely typed will be obvious to us and we aimed to eliminate the warnings by
adding suitable type definitions to objects, variables and function
declarations.

Along the same lines, we use Prettier + Eslint to enforce a consistent style
guide within the codebase. To run Eslnit, type in `yarn lint`.

## **Unit Test**

We use Jest and React testing library to perform unit tests. We aimed to include
unit tests to ensure low level but critical component logics are well tested. To run
tests, type in `yarn test`.

## **End to End Test**

We use Cypress to perform end user testing and validation of user interface.
Understand that UI changes can be more frequent and therefore hard to maintain,
we have decided to include E2E tests in the later stage. To use Cypress for test
development, start with `npx cypress open` to open up the desktop client of
Cypress. Click on one of the written test to run it in the test browser. Any
changes saved on the currently running test file will trigger a rerun of the
test. You can also run `npx cypress run` to run all tests headlessly.

## **Automated Testing**

On top of verifying program correctness during development, we also ensure
updates to the production build are always tested before merging. Please refer
to our [Continuous Integration section](DevOpsGuide#continuous-integration) to
find out more on how we perform testing with the help of Github Actions.

---

## **System Test**

> Take the whole system and test it against the system specifications.

As we are the sole developers of the entire application, we will function as QA
engineers to ensure the system is functioning properly and fails gracefully.

Test cases: 

- The website should be performant under reasonable load (500 users requesting for the
webpages within a span of 3 seconds)
   - Input: load the homepage using Jmeter with the above specifications.
   - Expected behavior: respond code 200 and report showing pages are loaded successfully.

#TODO (More details to be added)

## **Acceptance Test**

> Test the system to ensure it meets the user requirements.

Given below are instructions to test the application manually. In fact, we will
write the equivalent integration tests such that what's descriped below will
also be verified programmatically.

This section also serves as a guide for a potential user to see what are the
testifiable requirements for the application. Note that the
[user guide](UserGuide) will be the comprehensive source of all user permitted
interactions.

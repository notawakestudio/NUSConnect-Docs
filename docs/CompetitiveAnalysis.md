## **Going deeper**
We believe that softwares that we build should solve problems. All things aside, this project is created to solve realistic issues that we faced as teaching assistants (CS2030). We realized that certain work that we put in as TAs were super helpful for our students but they could be automated/reused/organized to save our time & the time of students from future batches as well. At the very least, this is what we hope to achieve based on our own needs and knowledge:
- A way to create weekly quiz that we can share to the students to do and learn from their attempts.
- A way to explain stuff related to the module and have it ready to be shared again for the future batches.
- A way to organize the resources we created for students to take advantage of what we know.
- A way to capture insightful question from students, and also the answer to these questions.
- A way to motivate students to participate in creation of exercise questions so that they can practice them before the exams.

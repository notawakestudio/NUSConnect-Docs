## **Going deeper**

We believe that softwares that we build should solve problems. All things aside,
this project is created to solve realistic issues that we faced as teaching
assistants (CS2030). We realized that certain work that we put in as TAs were
super helpful for our students but they could be automated/reused/organized to
save our time & the time of students from future batches as well. At the very
least, this is what we hope to achieve based on our own needs and knowledge:

- A way to create weekly quiz that we can share to the students to do and learn
  from their attempts.
- A way to explain stuff related to the module and have it ready to be shared
  again for the future batches.
- A way to organize the resources we created for students to take advantage of
  what we know.
- A way to capture insightful question from students, and also the answer to
  these questions.
- A way to motivate students to participate in creation of exercise questions so
  that they can practice them before the exams.
## **Why Not xxx & Why Us**

Here's our attempt to address the elephants in the room.

### Why Not LumiNUS

We improve on many of LumiNUS's core features such as quiz taking and forum post
viewing. We also make it easy to use our app as the navigation between the pages
is much smoother saving time and improving efficiency.

### Why Not Coursemology

If you are not aware, the Coursemology website states that it is

> built by teachers, for teachers

We however, are students who care about learning. We take pride in sharing our
perspective and bring functionalities that might be closer to the hearts of
fellow students. We literally walk our talk, among our target users.

### Why Not Piazza

We acknowledge that Piazza has a great forum functionality that support questions 
and answers among students. However, our platform includes integration with quiz
functionality and elements of gamification.

## **Going deeper**

We believe that softwares that we build should solve problems. All things aside,
this project is created to solve realistic issues that we faced as teaching
assistants (CS2030). We realized that certain work that we put in as TAs were
super helpful for our students but they could be automated/reused/organized to
save our time & the time of students from future batches as well. At the very
least, this is what we hope to achieve based on our own needs and knowledge:

- A way to create weekly quiz that we can share to the students to do and learn
  from their attempts.
- A way to explain stuff related to the module and have it ready to be shared
  again for the future batches.
- A way to organize the resources we created for students to take advantage of
  what we know.
- A way to capture insightful question from students, and also the answer to
  these questions.
- A way to motivate students to participate in creation of exercise questions so
  that they can practice them before the exams.

## **Integration**

Have you ever done something of the following:

1. Pulzzed over a difficult question in past-year-papers/exercise and decided to
   google for something relevant

## **Why Not LumiNUS & Why Us**

We improve on many of LumiNUS's core features such as quiz taking and forum post
viewing. We also make it easy to use our app as the navigation between the pages
is much smoother saving time and improving efficiency.

# The Real Introduction
Frustrated with the lack of material and information available from previous sem’s and the lack of functionality in the official learning management system LumiNUS, we set out to design a system where students can learn their module content in a more engaging way.

With our background as teaching assistants for the module CS2030(Programming methodology II), we have a burning desire to help our students strive for perfection. We know that learning takes time and continuous effort, but making the process of learning fun and enjoyable will greatly improve students’ performance. 

We hope that our project becomes a source of external motivating factors that nudge students to learn the materials by heart. We want students to feel good doing assignments, and be rewarded with virtual points and record their attempts for further analysis. We also want students to try alternative ways of learning, via questions and answers in a forum, via quizzes that are self generated or created by the TAs, and via consolidating their learning into articles to be shared with other module students in the wiki.

## **Note to readers**
As we are still in the process of building the application, some parts of the documentation are yet to be finalized. However, please feel free to look around and see what we have docmented so far:)

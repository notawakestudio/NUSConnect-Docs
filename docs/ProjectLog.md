## **Progress in a few words**

Also noting down some thoughts along the way...

### Week 1

First week of development saw significant changes to our application. Besides
the quiz functionality that I was working on, the landing page, dashboard as
well as other aspects of the project had great improvements made. Though UI is
not a focus in our initial phase of development, it was nice to view the
application and receive visual feedback from the work that we put in. There were
many challenges that we managed to overcome via discussion and experimentation.
We were able to decide on the schema of data to be stored and also create a few
mock data files to work with. The application was also finally deployed to the
cloud and we would be able to see real time updates to it with every PR we
merge. I think this week created a great foundation for us to continue to work
and improve our product towards final release.

### Week 2

Second week of development included UI improvements, the creation of our logo,
functionality improvements and allowed for users to login to access the pages.
We also added a backend on [deta base](https://www.deta.sh/) to the project and
revamped the UI used for documentation purposes. Continuing from the first week
of development, we refactored code and cleaned up redundant functions. Whilst
developing the pages, we realized that there was significant lag coming from
`getServerSideProps()` and started using `getStaticProps()` instead. As
development continued, we have changed the way we stored the data multiple times
and created a backend API written in flask to facilitate this. And with the
addition of the deta base backend, we are now able to get and post data with
ease. Overall, the improvements to the app this week have been substantial and
will be crucial moving forward.

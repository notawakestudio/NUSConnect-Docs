The details of issues (Bugs, Features, Tasks) can be found on the Github
[issues page](https://github.com/notawakestudio/NUSConnect/issues)

## **Progress in a few words**

Also noting down some thoughts along the way...

### Week 1

First week of development saw significant changes to our application. Besides
the quiz functionality that I was working on, the landing page, dashboard as
well as other aspects of the project had great improvements made. Though UI is
not a focus in our initial phase of development, it was nice to view the
application and receive visual feedback from the work that we put in. There were
many challenges that we managed to overcome via discussion and experimentation.
We were able to decide on the schema of data to be stored and also create a few
mock data files to work with. The application was also finally deployed to the
cloud and we would be able to see real time updates to it with every PR we
merge. I think this week created a great foundation for us to continue to work
and improve our product towards final release.

### Week 2

Second week of development included UI improvements, the creation of our logo,
functionality improvements and allowed for users to login to access the pages.
We also added a backend on [deta base](https://www.deta.sh/) to the project and
revamped the UI used for documentation purposes. Continuing from the first week
of development, we refactored code and cleaned up redundant functions. Whilst
developing the pages, we realized that there was significant lag coming from
`getServerSideProps()` and started using `getStaticProps()` instead. As
development continued, we have changed the way we stored the data multiple times
and created a backend API written in flask to facilitate this. And with the
addition of the deta base backend, we are now able to get and post data with
ease. Overall, the improvements to the app this week have been substantial and
will be crucial moving forward.

### Week 3

Last week's progress was slightly slow and we had to spend some time updating
all the documentation and publicity resources in preparation for milestone 1
submission. However, I am glad that the login functionality is now in place and
we are in good position to make the gamification side of the project. In terms
of quiz and forum functionalities, we were proceeding at a slower pace due to
more considerations required in terms of data storage and communication between
the front-end and the back-end. Overall, the improvements though small, were
still important as we head towards more complex work in the coming month.

31/5/2021 - Yong Liang

### Week 4

We made a lot of progress last week, with forum and quiz seeing major backend
improvements with relation to speed and functionality. We also improved the UI
and updated most of our website to support both mobile view and dark mode. We
are still behind on some of our goals like gamification and course selection but
I think that with the following weeks, things will start to pick up pace.
Overall, the changes made last week will put up in a better position to continue
development as we start to add more pages and more features to the app.

7/6/2021 - Jun Xiong

### Week 5

Further changes were made in order to get the forum and quiz basic
functionalities to be even more polish. There were many consuming tasks that
though not important individually, affect the overall user experience of our
application. We added things like the search and filter functionality to forum.
We also started to look at the highlight of our application: the integration
between forum and quiz. The ability to view a relevant post when reviewing a
quiz attempt was implemented and more updates to come in the following days!
Overall, I would say the week's progress was on the slower side of development.
However, there were many important lessons we learned through this journey. For
example, the exploration of data management packages such as SWR and react-query
for the front-end data fetching mechanism. There were also many minor design
bugs that we uncovered and fixed along the way. As we are soon reaching the
midway of our development, we hope to keep up with the consistency and make
realistic improvements towards finishing the application.

### Week 6

There were many minor but meaningful UI changes as well as functionality and
code abstraction. Many bugs were also addressed and we believe that the user
experience will be much smoother moving forward. Refactoring oir code and
cleaning up errors were also a focus of this weeks activity as we come close to
finishing all our core features. Quiz and forum now link to one another
seamlessly and users can see forum posts after finishing their quiz questions.
Users can also change their user name with ease. Finally, we improved our
documentation to include acceptance testing and other testing methods as well as
some improvements to our developer guide. Overall, we managed to clean up much
of our code and improved the functionality and readability of our code.

### Week 7

Last week was more hectic than expected as we were nearing milestone 2
submission. We wanted to make sure that the website is usable and without
significant bugs. We also aimed to include the setup for gamification into the
site so that we can share that with our testers and friends. However, the work
to get all the bugs fixed while adding new functionalities was time consuming.
And we had to update our documentations, posters and make a video for the
submission. Overall I am glad that we managed to fulfill 80% of our intended
tasks for the week. There was an interesting problem we encountered with user
login that I would like to share. While developing the website locally, Jun
Xiong and I usually used the same login credentials and found no issue with it.
However, when we were testing the production website and Jun Xiong logged in
with his GMail account, the user system was broken and all logins to the website
started to use Jun Xiong's profile instead. Even though the userId for the
logins were different, somehow the user retrieved from the database stuck with
one user account. After some investigation, I managed to locate the source of
error, which was the session mechanism. The userId was a mutable variable that
was attached to the user session. Somehow that information was not mutated
properly when new users are logged in. I removed the mutating variable and
looked through the documentation of the authentication service that we are
using. I found out that the token that comes with the session object in fact
contains the userId. Therefore, I no longer need to query the userId from
Firebase and could use it directly from the session object. This problem only
surfaced when we use the website in production and with multiple users. A great
lesson about the importance of testing, including user testing on production.

### Week 8

Last week was the week after the submission of milestone 2. Along with many bug
fixes, UI improvements and code optimizations we managed to accomplish a good
deal. As of now, most of the UI is looking synonymous with one another but there
is still some work to be done on the forum and wiki pages. We also made some
changes to our backend and database designs especially for the module and quests
to maintain a more consistent format throughout our application. Most of the
work last week was focused on the modules, scoreboard, badges and dashboard
pages as we are almost complete with the forum and quiz functionality. Moving
forward we intend on finishing our final functionality updates in the coming
week and start moving towards more rigors testing and documentation. All in all,
I feel that the UI updates that we made in the past week has added alot more
functionality to the application as a whole and if we can keep up the pace, our
app will be very complete by the end of orbital.

5/7/2021 - Jun Xiong

### Week 9

As we are nearing the end of the development cycle, the main focus of the week was
to complete any remaining features and make sure the use cases are supported. There 
were some details that we took the time to ensure they function properly. These include
search and sort of quizzes as well as another round of UI improvements. We also added 
more content to our documentation that explain the design decisions and inner workings 
of the front-end components. Along the way, we fixed some bugs related to mobile view and
resolved issues with regards to forum posts' order by week.

Even though the userId for the\nlogins were different, somehow the user retrieved from the database stuck with\none user account. After some investigation, I managed to locate the source of\nerror, which was the session mechanism. The userId was a mutable variable that\nwas attached to the user session. Somehow that information was not mutated\nproperly when new users are logged in. I removed the mutating variable and\nlooked through the documentation of the authentication service that we are\nusing. I found out that the token that comes with the session object in fact\ncontains the userId. Therefore, I no longer need to query the userId from\nFirebase and could use it directly from the session object.
